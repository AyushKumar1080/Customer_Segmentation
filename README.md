Customer Segmentation Using KMeans (End-to-End Project)

Context: This project is built to explore and demonstrate customer segmentation through unsupervised machine learning. It simulates a real-world supermarket scenario where customer data is collected via membership cards and analyzed using KMeans clustering to understand purchasing behavior.

Data Description: The dataset includes basic customer details: Customer ID, Gender, Age, Annual Income (in thousands), and Spending Score (a subjective metric based on customer behavior and purchases).

Objective: As a mall owner, your goal is to identify target customers that can be easily converted or retained, allowing the marketing team to shape strategies accordingly
